    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Goh Yi-Herng Keane currently studying in my 3rd year for a Diploma
  in Architecture in SP. Throughout my time in SP, we are given a chance each year to pick up
  an elective module where we can learn new skills that can potentially be useful in our future. 
  For my current Year 3 Elective Module, I have chosen Digital Fabrication (EP1000) as my elective module,
      and this webiste is a compilation of the fun things I've picked up in this module!</p>
    <p>This elective is organised around a self-directed project where students develop design thinking and prototyping skills. Students will be guided through a design thinking process followed by the development of a functional prototype. Students will apply design and digital fabrication process for developing a functional prototype that integrates these processes. Students will practise these skills in a design studio setting.</p>
  <p>Below are some of the places you can explore on my website!</p>

    <h2>My Blogs & Documentations</h2>
    <h3>3D Printing</h3>
    <p>We learnt how to create a piece on the modelling software Autodesk Fusion360, by imposing the chosen image for the chess piece, and tracing the outline
   followed by extruding out the 2d piece to create the chess piece in a 3d form.</p>

    <p>After we extracted the form of the chess piece, we then load the chess piece file into Ultimaker Cura, the software that prepares the files for 3d printing, to ensure that the dimensions were correct, and to ensure that the pieces were able to be printed with sufficient support such that the piece does not collapse during printing.</p>

   <p> Once arranged well, we then print it!</p>

<h3>Laser Cutting</h3>
   <p>Finishing the 3d Printing, we moved on to learn laser cutting, an important skill in producing pieces that helps to build up our prototype, again using Fusion360.</p>

    <p>The drawing is then saved as a DXF file, which we import it into CorelDraw that assists us in cutting and scoring it on the wooden board provided. I learn't that the each method, cutting and scoring, are identified by colour codes, red being cut, and green being score.</p>

   <p>After cutting, all I needed to do is to assemble and I get my musical box...</p>
