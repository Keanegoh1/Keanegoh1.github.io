    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Goh Yi-Herng Keane currently studying in my 3rd year for a Diploma
  in Architecture in SP. Throughout my time in SP, we are given a chance each year to pick up
  an elective module where we can learn new skills that can potentially be useful in our future. 
  For my current Year 3 Elective Module, I have chosen Digital Fabrication (EP1000) as my elective module,
      and this webiste is a compilation of the fun things I've picked up in this module!</p>
    <p>This elective is organised around a self-directed project where students develop design thinking and prototyping skills. Students will be guided through a design thinking process followed by the development of a functional prototype. Students will apply design and digital fabrication process for developing a functional prototype that integrates these processes. Students will practise these skills in a design studio setting.</p>
